The EMD-* and emd_* files in this directory were fetched from the EMDB database. A
simple Python script was used to search all available entries on the FTP server (as of
2 Nov 2016) to find the smallest map file (EMD-3197.map) and the smallest map file with
crystal symmetry (space group > 1; EMD-3001.map)
