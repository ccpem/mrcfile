Change log for mrcfile
======================

For next version
----------------

* mrcfile is now available through conda-forge (thanks to Billy Poon)
* Add support for FEI2-format extended headers (thanks to Michael Saur)
* Add nstart property for convenient access to the header nxstart, nystart and
  nzstart fields in the same style as the existing voxel_size property
* Read files without the final ' ' space in the map ID field (for example, as
  written by MotionCor2) without errors
* Add help text for mrcfile-header and mrcfile-validate command line programs
* Fix bug in stats calculations when an empty array is passed to set_data()
* Update Python and numpy version compatibility. Now works with Python 2.7
  and 3.4 - 3.9, and numpy 1.12 - 1.19
* Minor updates to documentation

Version 1.1.2 (2019-01-23)
--------------------------

* Fix incompatibility with numpy 1.16 by reading files into mutable bytearrays
  instead of immutable bytes objects. Note this will cause slower reading of
  bzip2-compressed files on Python 2 because Python 2's bz2 module does not
  support reading directly into a bytearray and therefore the data must be
  copied.
* Check that the file is large enough when reading the extended header.
  (Previously, the size was only checked for reading the data array.)

Version 1.1.1 (2019-01-17)
--------------------------

* Add automated tests for numpy 1.15 and Python 3.7
* Set maximum numpy version to 1.15 to avoid known incompatibility with 1.16

Version 1.1.0 (2018-11-21)
--------------------------

* Add open_async() function for background file loading
* Add new_mmap() function for fast creation of large files
* Speed up mrcfile-header command line tool by reading headers only, not data
* Allow opening of files with incorrect machine stamps in permissive mode
* Fix bug in validation of exttyp field in Python 3 (thanks to Holger Kohr)
* Fix bug in opening files with misleading exttyp information
* Update documentation to point to Python 3.6 instead of 2.7, and fix all
  cross-references
* Other documentation improvements

Version 1.0.4 (2018-01-22)
--------------------------

* Add command-line tools ('mrcfile-validate' and 'mrcfile-header') for easy MRC
  file validation and header viewing

Version 1.0.3 (2018-01-19)
--------------------------

* Fix bugs due to changed behaviour in numpy 1.14
* Add automated tests for numpy 1.13 and 1.14

Version 1.0.2 (2018-01-18)
--------------------------

* Add support for FEI-format extended headers
* Documentation improvements

Version 1.0.1 (2017-10-09)
--------------------------

* Add automated tests for Python 3.4 and 3.6
* Documentation improvements

Version 1.0.0 (2017-05-22)
--------------------------

Initial stable release

Main features:
* Clean, simple API for access to MRC files
* Easy to install and use
* Validation of files according to the MRC2014 format
* Seamless support for gzip and bzip2 files
* Memory-mapped file option for fast random access to very large files
* Runs in Python 2 & 3, on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows

Automatically tested on Linux and Mac OS X for Python versions 2.7 and 3.5
and numpy versions 1.11 and 1.12
