Change log for mrcfile
======================

Version 1.5.2 (2024-07-18)
--------------------------

* Fix opening of very large files with mmap (thanks to Hanjin Liu)

Version 1.5.1 (2024-07-11)
--------------------------

* Add support for numpy 2.0

Version 1.5.0 (2024-01-10)
--------------------------

* Add new 'indexed_extended_header' attribute to access the indexed part of
  the extended header if it exists (thanks to David Waterman). Note that this
  introduces a change in behaviour: code that used the 'extended_header'
  attribute directly to access items in FEI1- and FEI2-type extended headers
  will need to be updated to use 'indexed_extended_header' instead.
* Add support for numpy 1.24, 1.25 and 1.26 and Python 3.12

Version 1.4.3 (2022-09-22)
--------------------------

* Add helper functions for working with header labels.
* Update header statistics calculation to use float32 instead of float64. This
  is about twice as fast and uses less memory, but does make the calculations
  slightly less accurate and will overflow (to 'inf') if the data array
  contains very large values (larger than approximately 1e19).

Version 1.4.2 (2022-07-14)
--------------------------

* Add support for passing file names as pathlib Path objects.

Version 1.4.1 (2022-07-12)
--------------------------

* Add file names to mrcfile-header output
* Improvements to validation functions (mrcfile-validate command and the
  mrcfile.validate() function):
  * Add a message with the file name of each file processed, to enable valid
    and invalid files to be identified.
  * Add a message confirming that valid files are valid.
  * Ensure that all files are processed when validating multiple files, even
    if some are invalid or raise exceptions on opening.
* Add support for numpy 1.23 and Python 3.10 and 3.11

Version 1.4.0 (2022-07-02)
--------------------------

* Change default MRC format version from 20140 to 20141 and update validation
  to allow files with both format numbers as valid.
* Add mrcfile.read() and mrcfile.write() functions for quick one-off accesses
  to the MRC data array without needing to keep an MrcFile object open (thanks
  to Alister Burt).
* Allow the extended header to be set when creating a file with
  mrcfile.new_mmap() (thanks to James Parkhurst).
* Add file size checks to avoid allocating huge amounts of memory when opening
  corrupt or non-MRC files in permissive mode.
* Update numpy and Python version compatibility to drop support for Python
  3.4 and 3.5 and numpy < 1.16, and add support for numpy 1.21 and 1.22.
* Fix bug intepreting FEI extended headers on big-endian hardware.
* Documentation updates.

Version 1.3.0 (2021-02-18)
--------------------------

* Add support for the new proposed data mode 12 (numpy float16). Note that
  this causes a change in behaviour: previously float16 arrays would be
  widened to float32 and saved in mode 2; now they will be kept in float16 and
  saved in mode 12, which could be incompatible with other software.
* Issue Python warnings if NaN or infinite values are found when a new data
  array is passed to set_data() (or if update_header_stats() is called).
* Update numpy version compatibility to include numpy 1.20
* Minor updates to documentation

Version 1.2.0 (2020-11-30)
--------------------------

* mrcfile is now available through conda-forge (thanks to Billy Poon)
* Add support for FEI2-format extended headers (thanks to Michael Saur)
* Add nstart property for convenient access to the header nxstart, nystart and
  nzstart fields in the same style as the existing voxel_size property
* Read files without the final ' ' space in the map ID field (for example, as
  written by MotionCor2) without errors
* Add help text for mrcfile-header and mrcfile-validate command line programs
* Fix bug in stats calculations when an empty array is passed to set_data()
* Update Python and numpy version compatibility. Now works with Python 2.7
  and 3.4 - 3.9, and numpy 1.12 - 1.19
* Minor updates to documentation

Version 1.1.2 (2019-01-23)
--------------------------

* Fix incompatibility with numpy 1.16 by reading files into mutable bytearrays
  instead of immutable bytes objects. Note this will cause slower reading of
  bzip2-compressed files on Python 2 because Python 2's bz2 module does not
  support reading directly into a bytearray and therefore the data must be
  copied.
* Check that the file is large enough when reading the extended header.
  (Previously, the size was only checked for reading the data array.)

Version 1.1.1 (2019-01-17)
--------------------------

* Add automated tests for numpy 1.15 and Python 3.7
* Set maximum numpy version to 1.15 to avoid known incompatibility with 1.16

Version 1.1.0 (2018-11-21)
--------------------------

* Add open_async() function for background file loading
* Add new_mmap() function for fast creation of large files
* Speed up mrcfile-header command line tool by reading headers only, not data
* Allow opening of files with incorrect machine stamps in permissive mode
* Fix bug in validation of exttyp field in Python 3 (thanks to Holger Kohr)
* Fix bug in opening files with misleading exttyp information
* Update documentation to point to Python 3.6 instead of 2.7, and fix all
  cross-references
* Other documentation improvements

Version 1.0.4 (2018-01-22)
--------------------------

* Add command-line tools ('mrcfile-validate' and 'mrcfile-header') for easy MRC
  file validation and header viewing

Version 1.0.3 (2018-01-19)
--------------------------

* Fix bugs due to changed behaviour in numpy 1.14
* Add automated tests for numpy 1.13 and 1.14

Version 1.0.2 (2018-01-18)
--------------------------

* Add support for FEI-format extended headers
* Documentation improvements

Version 1.0.1 (2017-10-09)
--------------------------

* Add automated tests for Python 3.4 and 3.6
* Documentation improvements

Version 1.0.0 (2017-05-22)
--------------------------

Initial stable release

Main features:
* Clean, simple API for access to MRC files
* Easy to install and use
* Validation of files according to the MRC2014 format
* Seamless support for gzip and bzip2 files
* Memory-mapped file option for fast random access to very large files
* Runs in Python 2 & 3, on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows

Automatically tested on Linux and Mac OS X for Python versions 2.7 and 3.5
and numpy versions 1.11 and 1.12
